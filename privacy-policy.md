• To improve the functionality and performance of the App.

• To analyze trends and understand how the app is being used.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share any personal information because we do not collect it. However, Khair may use third-party service providers for functions such as analytics or advertising, and these providers may collect non-personal information.
• Third-party Services: The App may integrate with third-party services like Google Analytics, Apple Pay, or Google Pay, which may collect certain data to operate properly. For example, payment processors collect payment details but we do not store or handle them directly.
